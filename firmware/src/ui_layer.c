/* Felucca quick layers: while a page button is held, the keys and KNOB 1..4
 * are its shortcuts and its map shows over the page. One table (LAYERS) drives the gesture, the keys, the knobs,
 * the LEDs and the overlay:
 *   FX   HOLD  the performance effects (perform.c) and the track mutes while held; KNOB 1..4 its macros
 *   GLO  SET   black keys 1..4 (F#3 G#3 A#3 C#4) T1..T4 MUTE (latched; lit = sounding), F3..B3 SOLO T1..T4 while
 *              held (HOLD cells, a corner triangle), C4 UNMUTE ALL, F4 TAP tempo; KNOB 1..4 T1..T4 LEVEL;
 *              GLO + PLAY: from the top without stopping
 *   SCL  SET   any key: its note name is ROOT; KNOB 1..4 ROOT SCL CHRD VOIC (LY_SCL: the SCL page's first two,
 *              the CHORD page's two; QNT TRN stay on SCL); the LEDs show the root lit and the scale's notes breathing
 *   EDIT SET   the white keys from F3: the engines in PRESETS order (one key each, the NENG_SHOWN one can pick:
 *              engines.c eng_vis), the next white key INIT (LY_INIT: E5)
 *              (the dialog); KNOB 1 ENG, 2 No. (the engine's sounds), 3 FAV. Sound loads as on PRESETS: the steps
 *              stay, SAVE held undoes, the editor gets RELOAD; they apply while playing too
 *   SEQ  SET   (1.2, on the SEQ pages that show the pattern: STEP / the DRUM grid, PATTERN, CHANCE, AUTOMATION; elsewhere
 *              SEQ held opens SONG as before) TOOLS: the white keys from F3 the sequence tools (ui_tools.c: CLEAR,
 *              REVERSE, SHIFT < >, RANDOM, COOK; on a DRUM track BEAT and the lane's CLEAR REVERSE FILL RANDOM), black
 *              keys 1..8 the lane (DRUM); KNOB 1..4 the PATTERN page's LEN DIV SWING GATE. Each action one undo (SAVE
 *              held), OCT- the track as the layer opened (tl_open)
 *   REC  SET   (1.1.5, on every page; REC's tap still arms / disarms) the white keys from F3: CLEAR (the selected
 *              track's steps and automation, no dialog: one undo, SAVE held), CLICK (OFF REC ON), COUNT-IN (OFF 1 BAR
 *              2 BARS), CLICK LEVEL (LOW MID HIGH), each press the next value; KNOB 1..3 the same three. The settings
 *              are MENU > AUDIO's (ui.c rp_get / rp_put: one store), saved when the layer closes; OCT- puts back the
 *              settings and the track as the layer opened (tl_open). Replaces the old REC held on SEQ (Discussion #91:
 *              the CLEAR Tn SEQUENCE? dialog and its "HOLD: CLEAR" hint)
 * The gesture: let go before HOLD (the menu: 0.3 .. 0.6 s) with nothing else touched: a tap, the button's page.
 * Held past HOLD alone: the map (a peek), letting go does nothing. A key, a knob or a button meanwhile: a combo,
 * the map at once, no tap. Keys pressed with the button down are the layer's (seq.c keyboard_block): silent, no
 * MIDI, never recorded; keys held before stay notes. Only one layer at a time: a second layer button is ignored.
 * PLAY and REC work in every layer (GLO + PLAY: RESTART); SAVE, HOME, SEQ and the other page buttons are swallowed. In SET
 * layers OCT± do not shift the octave: OCT- (on release, not with OCT+) puts back what the layer changed since it
 * opened. A HOLD key's effect lasts until the key is let go, the map with it. No layer in the menu, a dialog,
 * NAME or the UPDATE MODE countdown. After a tap, until the layer has been opened once: "HOLD [GLO] QUICK"
 * (the seen bits are kept with the settings, favorites.c spare byte).
 * The lock (Discussion #83): a double tap (the second press within LY_DTAP_MS of the first tap, both let go before
 * HOLD, nothing else touched) opens the map and keeps it open with no button held (ui.lock): ly_down() counts the
 * lock as the button held, so the keys (seq.c keyboard_block: kb_lock), KNOB 1..4, OCT-, PLAY act exactly as held.
 * A tap of its button closes it (the press hands it back to the button: held on, a peek; let go, closed; never a
 * tap), so do another page button, HOME, SAVE, SEQ (each then acts as always), the menu, a dialog, NAME. The first
 * tap is not deferred (a single tap opens its page at once, no lag): it opens the page and remembers the page it
 * left (lys.nv); the second tap locks the layer over that page, put back, so a double tap leaves the page as it was.
 * A first tap that acted instead of opening a page (EDIT on STEP: clear the step; on USER / PROJECT: rename) arms no
 * double tap: two quick taps there still act twice. */
