# MAKU

[![License: GPL-3.0-only](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0--only-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**MAKU (幕間機)** is an always-on ambience machine for the M-VAVE FM-1: power it on and a new, random, in-key
world is already playing. Four parts (a pulse, a floor, a haze, a voice), four volume knobs, three macros per part,
and buttons that are verbs (dive, drift, wobble, swell, keep, scramble, cascade, twist). Nothing is saved: every boot is a
new world, and HOME held makes another.

MAKU is built on [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca) by Leo Kuroshita (Hügelton Instruments), GPL-3.0-only.
The sequencer editing, presets and projects, engine pages, web editor and the other Felucca features are removed (see
[docs/AMBIENT.md](docs/AMBIENT.md), "捨てるもの"). Installing is at your own risk: M-VAVE's updater or the installer's
**Return to official V15** takes you back. Not yet verified on hardware.

## What it does

- **Four parts**: 1 pulse (kick, DRUM), 2 floor (drone, PHYS), 3 haze (shimmer, GRAIN), 4 voice (arpeggiated phrase, PHYS);
  a boot picks the sounds, root, scale, tempo (about 70-90 BPM) and every macro at random
- **KNOB 1-4** set the volume of parts 1-4 and move the focus to that part; **SELECT / PRESETS / ALGORITHM** are the
  focused part's three macros, each moving several parameters at once, and turning right always makes it livelier
- **Keys** play the focused part's sound, unquantized; every played note also melts into the voice's phrase
- **Buttons are verbs**, held: PLAY dives, FX drifts, LFO wobbles, ENV swells, SAVE keeps, SEQ scrambles, ARP cascades,
  EDIT twists, GLO sets tempo / swing / duck, SCL sets root / scale / register, OCT- / OCT+ step the key around the
  circle of fifths; while one is held the three knobs move its own three parameters
- **Kick**: when the kick part has focus the keys become a 16-step sequencer
- **HOME** held: a new random world. HOME + OCT-: the settings menu (colour, screen off, calibration)
- **MIDI**: USB and TRS in, clock follow; CC20 is the kick density. USB also carries the stereo audio input

| --- | --- |
| `firmware/` | firmware sources: `src/` app, `hal/` hardware layer, `loader/` update loader |
| `tools/` | build script, generators, package maker, installer and sample uploader |
| `assets/` | UI font, icon names, CC0 instrument samples |
| `web/` | the web installer, the earlier editor and the browser emulator (`web/emu/`); the new editor: [Felucca-WebApp](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca-WebApp) |
| `tests/` | tests that run on the build machine |
| `LICENSES/` | licence texts of the bundled fonts, icons, ported DSP and SDK files |

## If the FM-1 does not start

If an update is interrupted and the FM-1 stays black, check whether a computer sees it as a USB device named
**WL80UBOOT** (or a USB mass-storage device with ID 4C4A:8057). That is the chip's built-in boot mode, and
the FM-1 can be brought back:

- First try another USB data cable, and close every other app that uses MIDI, then run the web installer again.
- If it stays in boot mode, [FM-1 Transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter) reads and
  writes the FM-1's flash from a Mac through a Seeed XIAO RP2040 (three wires to the FM-1's USB lines). Back up
  the flash first, then write the official firmware (M-VAVE's FM-1.fwsc).
